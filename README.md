# Dotfiles Builder

## Author
SÃ©bastien Lavoie (github@lavoie.sl)

## Description
Compile several dotfiles using configurations and doing some tests only once.

For example:

  * Concatenate some paths in $PATH only if directory exists and is not already in $PATH
  * Add aliases using easy file structure with auto-escaping
  * Determine best locale based on available locales
  * Determine best $EDITOR/$VISUAL
  * etc.

The goal is to optimize `.bashrc` and other dotfiles to only include what works. 

Expensive checks can be done like looping through a lot of choices of even doing a `locate libpng.h`
because the `.bashrc` is compiled once, not everytime you start a new shell. 

If you modify your installation of your settings, re-run the build script

## Howto
Right now, it is not very usable, but running [skeleton.sh](https://github.com/lavoiesl/dotfiles-builder/blob/master/skeleton.sh) will output a basic `.bashrc`.

See [examples/.bashrc](https://github.com/lavoiesl/dotfiles-builder/blob/master/examples/.bashrc).

## Todo
Whole lots of things
